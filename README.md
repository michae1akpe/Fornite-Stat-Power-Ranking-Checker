# Fornite-Stat-Power-Ranking-Checker
Simple Python script that allow users to check their Fortnite game stats

This project was inspired by some of my mate bantering about checking people stats while in game so i decided to automate the process of having to search up their stats by using an API to curl a request to the web server.

***You must have the python module "requests" installed. (pip install requests)***
***You must get your own TRN-Api-Key from "https://tracker.gg/developers" unless the request can not be completed and you will probably get a '401 error'***

How to run python scripts:

***Mac/Linux***

git clone https://github.com/michae1akpe/Fortnite-Stats.git

cd Fortnite-Stats

python3 Fortnite Tracker.py ***or*** python3 Power Ranking Tracker.py

***Windows***

Download zip file from github

Extract file into a working directory

Run in your preferred text editor
