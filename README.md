# Fornite-Stat-Power-Ranking-Checker
Simple Python script that allow users to check their Fortnite game stats

This project was inspired by some of my mate bantering about checking people stats while in game so i decided to automate the process of having to search up their stats by using an API to curl a request to the web server.

***You must get your own TRN-Api-Key from "https://tracker.gg/developers" unless the request can not be completed and you will probably get a '401 error'***

***NOTE***
With version 1 of the Power Ranking Tracker script it ***fails*** and prints a long error if the username you have entered has no Power Ranking, so do not be alarmed by this. It will be corrected in due time with error handling.

Please feel free to to contact me if you have any problems or if you have any improvement i can make please do contact me. :)
